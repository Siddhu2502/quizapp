00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hi, welcome to the session on

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.866
design thinking.

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.533
In this module,

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:11.100
you will gain an insight
into the various stages of design

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.300
thinking, lifecycle of design thinking
tools used in various stages of design

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:22.100
thinking, detailed learning on stage
one, empathize research your users needs.

7
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:26.233
Stage two, Define
still a user's needs and problems.

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.666
Stage three, Ideate challenge assumptions
and create ideas.

9
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:34.600
Stage
four, Prototype start to create solutions.

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.200
Stage five, Test Try your solutions out.

11
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.833
Let us now understand
what is design thinking,

12
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.900
an iterative process that helps understand
the user requirements

13
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.900
and identifies
various angles to solve the problem.

14
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.833
Once various alternatives as analyzed,

15
00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:55.033
the best strategic solution is identified
and applied.

16
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:59.033
This approach to fully analyze
the given problem and bring about

17
00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:03.500
a solution based approach to solving
problems is the aspect of design thinking.

18
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.000
Let us now understand the various steps

19
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.366
that is done in design
thinking to reach the optimal solution.

20
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:14.900
The key steps include process is iterative
and expansive,

21
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.733
focusing on the stated problem

22
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.166
than to arrive at a solution

23
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:22.266
immediately, more time to be spent
to understand the fundamental issue.

24
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.833
A solution is arrived only after
the root issue is identified and analyzed.

25
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:29.900
A wide range of potential solutions
is identified

26
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.000
before zeroing on the best solution.

27
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:36.100
After identifying the solution,
the final proposal is put forward.

28
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:40.600
The life cycle of design
thinking can be broadly classified

29
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.033
into three categories as understand,
explore, materialize where understand stage

30
00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:51.533
has empathize and define some stages.
Explore has ideas and prototypes, upstages.

31
00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:54.633
Materialize has test and implement
some stages.

32
00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:57.700
The five stages of design thinking.

33
00:01:57.866 --> 00:01:58.800
Stage one.

34
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.533
Empathize, research your users needs.

35
00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:05.766
Stage two Define, state to a user's
needs and problems.

36
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.433
Stage three Ideate,
challenge assumptions and create ideas.

37
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.366
Stage
four Prototype, start to create solutions.

38
00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:17.966
Stage five Test. Try your solutions out.

39
00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:20.033
Let's briefly

40
00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:22.966
understand the iterative design
thinking solutions.

41
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.866
The explanation is referenced from

42
00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:30.433
https://canvas.unl.edu/

43
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.000
Stage one Empathize research
your users needs here,

44
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.000
you should gain an empathetic
understanding of the problem

45
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.033
you are trying to solve,
typically through user research.

46
00:02:41.366 --> 00:02:44.966
Empathy is crucial
to a human centered design process, such

47
00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:48.966
as design thinking, because it allows you
to set aside your own assumptions

48
00:02:48.966 --> 00:02:52.633
about the world and gain
real insight into users and their needs.

49
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.300
Stage two define stating
a user's needs and problems.

50
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.266
It's time to accumulate the information
gathered during the empathize stage.

51
00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:05.800
You then analyze your observations
and synthesize them

52
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.166
to define the core problems
you and your team have identified.

53
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.233
These definitions are called problem
statements.

54
00:03:12.566 --> 00:03:15.300
You can create personas to help
keep your efforts

55
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.966
human centered
before proceeding to ideation.

56
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.866
Stage three Ideate challenge assumptions
and create ideas.

57
00:03:23.466 --> 00:03:25.866
Now you're ready to generate ideas.

58
00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:29.666
The solid background of knowledge
from the first two phases means

59
00:03:29.666 --> 00:03:31.966
you can start to think outside the box.

60
00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:35.766
Look for alternative ways to view
the problem and identify innovative

61
00:03:35.766 --> 00:03:38.433
solutions to the problem statement
you've created.

62
00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:41.333
Brainstorming is particularly useful here.

63
00:03:41.966 --> 00:03:45.500
Stage
four Prototype start to create solutions.

64
00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:48.300
This is an experimental phase.

65
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.633
The aim is to identify the best
possible solution for each problem found.

66
00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:57.566
Your team should produce some inexpensive,
scaled down versions of the product

67
00:03:57.733 --> 00:04:00.366
or specific features
found within the product.

68
00:04:00.566 --> 00:04:03.066
To investigate the ideas you've generated.

69
00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:05.933
This could involve simply paper
prototyping.

70
00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:07.533
Stage five.

71
00:04:07.533 --> 00:04:09.733
Test, try your solutions out.

72
00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.100
Evaluators rigorously test the prototypes.

73
00:04:13.466 --> 00:04:17.266
Although this is the final phase, design
thinking is iterative.

74
00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:21.733
Teams often use the results to redefine
one or more for their problems,

75
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.166
so you can return to previous stages
to make further iterations,

76
00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:30.966
alterations and refinements
to fine or rule out alternative solutions.

77
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.000
Let us now

78
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.266
understand deeply about empathize,
explanation referenced from

79
00:04:38.266 --> 00:04:41.866
https://canvas.unl.edu/

80
00:04:42.466 --> 00:04:45.000
While not a typical step in the career
planning

81
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.866
process, empathy is incredibly important.

82
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.933
You need to think about yourself,
your needs and the factors

83
00:04:51.933 --> 00:04:55.100
that impact your decisions
when creating your IDP.

84
00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:58.266
You need to connect who you are
and what you believe with

85
00:04:58.266 --> 00:05:01.333
what do you want to do
in order to create a coherent life.

86
00:05:01.566 --> 00:05:06.300
Burnett and Evans 2019
There are a few ways to achieve this.

87
00:05:06.933 --> 00:05:10.133
Think of the pressures
you faced that influence your decision.

88
00:05:10.466 --> 00:05:11.766
Are you pursuing a career

89
00:05:11.766 --> 00:05:15.866
because it's something you want to do
or because of an external influence.

90
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.766
Develop a personal life.

91
00:05:17.766 --> 00:05:22.133
View what is important in your life
outside of your career and why

92
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.066
develop a worldview.

93
00:05:24.066 --> 00:05:26.466
Think about topics
like the purpose of work,

94
00:05:26.633 --> 00:05:29.833
how your career will impact others,
and how your career

95
00:05:29.866 --> 00:05:32.433
can further
your personal growth and development.

96
00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:34.966
What are you curious about?

97
00:05:34.966 --> 00:05:37.600
What sparks
your interest in your daily life?

98
00:05:37.966 --> 00:05:40.066
Instead of thinking about your passion,

99
00:05:40.066 --> 00:05:43.366
think about a problem
you want to solve or investigate further.

100
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.466
Most people
can't identify a single passion.

101
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.500
So when you're thinking about career
exploration, trying

102
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.666
to figure out what you are
passionate about can be a fool's errand.

103
00:05:53.266 --> 00:05:56.266
The answers to these questions
will continuously change

104
00:05:56.266 --> 00:05:59.233
as you move through life and face
new challenges.

105
00:05:59.566 --> 00:06:03.366
But it's always important to understand
how you fit into your career

106
00:06:03.366 --> 00:06:05.233
goals and development plans.

107
00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.333
Listed here are the various tools

108
00:06:08.333 --> 00:06:11.333
that can be used to conduct the Empathize
sub stage.

109
00:06:12.366 --> 00:06:15.166
Listed here is the approach
to understand the problem

110
00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:18.133
and to analyze what the user
is trying to express.

111
00:06:19.033 --> 00:06:23.700
Here we understand the user requirements
in more detail by asking the what, how

112
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.933
and why questions to get a deeper clarity
on the requirements.

113
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.600
Some steps that are often taken
during the stage of the design

114
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.000
thinking methodology
are consulting subject matter experts

115
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
about their insights, engaging
more personally with an issue to gain

116
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.266
a better understanding
of a user's POV of having

117
00:06:43.266 --> 00:06:46.466
in-depth conversations
about the topic with other designers

118
00:06:46.566 --> 00:06:49.266
immersing oneself
in a physical environment.

119
00:06:50.566 --> 00:06:53.166
An empathy map is a collaborative tool,
teams

120
00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:56.366
can use to gain a deeper insight
into their customers.

121
00:06:56.966 --> 00:07:00.666
Much like a user persona,
an empathy map can represent

122
00:07:00.666 --> 00:07:03.700
a group of users,
such as a customer segment.

123
00:07:04.333 --> 00:07:07.033
The empathy map was originally created
by Dave

124
00:07:07.033 --> 00:07:10.833
Gray and has gained much popularity
within the agile community.

125
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.800
Empathy maps can be used whenever you find
a need

126
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.400
to immerse yourself
in a user's environment.

127
00:07:18.066 --> 00:07:19.333
They can be helpful.

128
00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:24.500
For example, when diving into the customer
segments of a business model, canvas

129
00:07:24.633 --> 00:07:29.633
elaborating on user personas capturing
behaviors when interviewing a customer.

130
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.033
Building out the user in the user story.

131
00:07:33.266 --> 00:07:35.100
Shown here is a simple empathy

132
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.700
map of a person buying a TV.

133
00:07:39.133 --> 00:07:42.266
Empathy interviews,
usually a one on one conversations

134
00:07:42.266 --> 00:07:46.166
that use open ended questions
to elicit stories about specific

135
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.600
experiences
that help uncover unacknowledged needs,

136
00:07:50.233 --> 00:07:52.666
a protocol
allows the interviewer to probe more

137
00:07:52.666 --> 00:07:55.700
deeply into stories
than a more traditional interview.

138
00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.300
Analogies are a great way for us to build
empathy with uses to synthesize

139
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.400
and define information and to generate
new ideas around a problem.

140
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.966
We use analogies to gain a fresh way
of looking at an environment,

141
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:14.066
and we use them in instances where direct
observation is hard to achieve.

142
00:08:15.333 --> 00:08:17.333
This method helps you uncover needs

143
00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:21.533
users are often unaware of
or can't always accurately express.

144
00:08:22.133 --> 00:08:24.900
Typically, users are observed
in either their natural

145
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.766
setting
or during a set up observation test.

146
00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:31.400
Once you've identified
the right end, users record them

147
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.366
while they're experiencing the problem
you're aiming to solve.

148
00:08:34.933 --> 00:08:38.000
Observing what was said,
the feelings that were evoked

149
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.833
and behaviors noted will help guide you
in innovative solutions.

150
00:08:42.866 --> 00:08:46.633
Extreme users are a select group of people
that will typically provide

151
00:08:46.633 --> 00:08:50.066
excellent insights
that other users often won't disclose.

152
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.833
These groups will often magnify problems
and needs.

153
00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:57.600
Once you've identified your group, engage
with them to

154
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.766
establish their feelings, thoughts
and behaviors from there

155
00:09:01.866 --> 00:09:06.033
evaluate the needs that mainstream users
might have trouble expressing.

156
00:09:06.633 --> 00:09:09.700
While you may not be able to please
the extreme users,

157
00:09:09.866 --> 00:09:13.066
this is a good reference point
for improving the experience

158
00:09:13.066 --> 00:09:15.966
for your motor average
or the majority of your users.

159
00:09:16.933 --> 00:09:18.100
Body storming is an

160
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.233
exceptional way to practice
empathy as it immerses

161
00:09:21.233 --> 00:09:25.133
you fully in the user's environment
to perform body storming.

162
00:09:25.166 --> 00:09:28.766
You wear a special pair of goggles
that simulate vision impairments

163
00:09:28.766 --> 00:09:32.266
and try to accomplish a simple task
while wearing the goggles

164
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.933
in order to implement body storming.

165
00:09:34.966 --> 00:09:39.333
Create an environment, an atmosphere
that accurately depict the user's setting

166
00:09:39.333 --> 00:09:42.900
and is filled with things you would find
in a real world environment.

167
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.433
Duplicating the real world environment
helps boosts

168
00:09:46.433 --> 00:09:49.500
your empathy, understand
how solutions will work,

169
00:09:49.633 --> 00:09:53.200
and give you a hands on reference
point for later in the process.

170
00:09:54.366 --> 00:09:57.766
A design thinking empathy map provides
four major areas

171
00:09:57.766 --> 00:10:02.666
to focus our attention on, which gives us
an overview of a person's experience.

172
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.700
The four major areas
reflect four key traits and refer to what

173
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.066
the user said, did, thought and felt.

174
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:14.733
The first two are a bit easier,
but determining what they thought and felt

175
00:10:14.733 --> 00:10:20.100
requires careful observations and analysis
when asking what the user thought.

176
00:10:20.466 --> 00:10:24.300
Consider what the user might be thinking
their motivations,

177
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.033
goals, needs and desires from this

178
00:10:28.233 --> 00:10:31.066
ask yourself
what does this tell you about his

179
00:10:31.066 --> 00:10:34.233
or her beliefs.
In reference to what they felt,

180
00:10:34.366 --> 00:10:36.566
You're asking about the user's emotions.

181
00:10:36.966 --> 00:10:40.433
Subtle cues
such as body language, word choice

182
00:10:40.433 --> 00:10:43.233
and tone of voice
can be infinitely valuable.

183
00:10:44.433 --> 00:10:47.233
A simple body storm example is shown here.

184
00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:51.266
A simple journey

185
00:10:51.266 --> 00:10:54.866
map is shown in this picture.

186
00:10:56.166 --> 00:10:57.600
This stage of the process

187
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.500
involves designers succinctly
articulating the challenge or problem

188
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.300
they need to solve with their design.
After empathizing,

189
00:11:05.366 --> 00:11:09.900
a designer integrates their researched
understanding into the human centric issue

190
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.533
at hand and outlines
the problem statement.

191
00:11:13.133 --> 00:11:17.100
In this stage, designers
will analyze their observations completed

192
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.166
throughout the empathy stage
and work on synthesizing that information.

193
00:11:21.533 --> 00:11:24.933
Forming a problem statement
that is succinct as an important part

194
00:11:24.933 --> 00:11:29.066
of this phase that ensures a human
centered approach by focusing on the end

195
00:11:29.066 --> 00:11:30.100
user.

196
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.033
So instead of focusing on what
the company might need to do,

197
00:11:34.066 --> 00:11:37.300
the definition stage of the design
thinking process should help

198
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.533
state what the user needs
as a way of defining the problem.

199
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.333
For example, company centered thinking,
we need to increase

200
00:11:45.333 --> 00:11:50.233
our educational software sales
by X percent. Human centered thinking

201
00:11:50.433 --> 00:11:55.000
students need great technology in order
to successfully master tech concepts.

202
00:11:56.266 --> 00:11:57.600
Listed here are the tools

203
00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.600
that can be used
for design stage of design thinking.

204
00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:06.866
Point of view POV in design
thinking is a written, actionable

205
00:12:06.866 --> 00:12:11.300
statement that expresses the problem
that the design team is trying to address.

206
00:12:11.933 --> 00:12:16.300
This is also often called
a problem statement that is an expression

207
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:21.066
of the problem or problems that customers
identified the empathize stage.

208
00:12:22.066 --> 00:12:24.933
An approach to point of view is done
by asking

209
00:12:24.933 --> 00:12:28.433
a few questions and brainstorming
on the initial responses.

210
00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:33.166
Use why how laddering to flesh out
varying user needs and find a

211
00:12:33.166 --> 00:12:37.600
middle ground that's both meaningful
and actionable. As a general rule

212
00:12:37.733 --> 00:12:42.700
asking why yields abstract statements
and asking how yield specific statements,

213
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:48.133
oftentimes abstract statements
are more meaningful but not as actionable.

214
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.000
Ideation is a

215
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
creative process where designers
generate ideas in sessions,

216
00:12:54.033 --> 00:12:57.533
for example,
brainstorming worst possible idea,

217
00:12:57.833 --> 00:13:00.766
it is the third stage in the design
thinking process.

218
00:13:01.366 --> 00:13:05.133
Participants gather with open minds
to produce as many ideas

219
00:13:05.133 --> 00:13:07.400
as they can to address a problem statement

220
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.266
in a facilitated judgment
free environment.

221
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.100
In the ideation phase,
you'll explore and come up

222
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.200
with as many ideas as possible.

223
00:13:16.566 --> 00:13:20.466
Some of these ideas will go on
to be potential solutions to your design

224
00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:21.300
challenge.

225
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.733
Some will end up on the reject pile
at this stage.

226
00:13:24.866 --> 00:13:28.066
The focus is on quantity of ideas
rather than quality.

227
00:13:28.366 --> 00:13:31.066
The main aim of an ideation
session is to uncover

228
00:13:31.066 --> 00:13:34.900
and explore new angles and avenues
to think outside the box.

229
00:13:35.533 --> 00:13:39.033
For the sake of innovation and creativity,
it is essential

230
00:13:39.033 --> 00:13:41.933
that the ideation phase be a judgment free
zone.

231
00:13:42.866 --> 00:13:46.400
Listed here are the various tools
that can be used for ideation

232
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.033
process in design thinking.

233
00:13:49.066 --> 00:13:50.666
Brain writing offers an

234
00:13:50.666 --> 00:13:54.533
alternative to classical brainstorming.
In brain writing

235
00:13:54.666 --> 00:13:58.700
the participants do not discuss
and exchange their ideas verbally,

236
00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.400
but rather produce
their ideas in written form.

237
00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.433
Design thinking celebrates
ideation techniques such

238
00:14:05.433 --> 00:14:07.066
as challenging assumptions.

239
00:14:07.066 --> 00:14:09.633
Worst possible idea and scamper.

240
00:14:09.733 --> 00:14:12.500
All of which help us as designers
to be creative

241
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.700
and use our imaginations
by questioning status quo.

242
00:14:16.933 --> 00:14:19.966
Mind mapping is used to represent
how ideas or

243
00:14:19.966 --> 00:14:23.166
other items are linked to a central idea
and to each other.

244
00:14:23.733 --> 00:14:28.733
Mind maps are used to generate,
visualize, structure and classify ideas

245
00:14:28.733 --> 00:14:32.500
to look for patterns and insights
that provide key design criteria.

246
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.566
Look for connections between clusters
and insights.

247
00:14:36.833 --> 00:14:40.366
A simple mind map example.

248
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.200
Perhaps

249
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.233
the simplest creative technique
is the creative pause,

250
00:14:46.833 --> 00:14:49.600
with the creative pause,
you practiced clearing your mind

251
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.900
and becoming more aware
of your surroundings.

252
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.433
The point of the pause is to avoid getting
so wrapped up in the flow of life

253
00:14:56.433 --> 00:14:59.366
that you become oblivious
to the possibilities around you.

254
00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:04.633
The power of ten considers challenges
through frames of various magnitudes.

255
00:15:06.133 --> 00:15:09.333
A prototype is
a simple, experimental model of a proposed

256
00:15:09.333 --> 00:15:13.200
solution used to test or validate
ideas, design assumptions

257
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:18.366
and other aspects of its conceptualization
quickly and cheaply so that the designer

258
00:15:19.066 --> 00:15:23.333
involved can make appropriate refinements
or possible changes in direction.

259
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.633
Low fidelity prototyping involves

260
00:15:26.633 --> 00:15:30.266
the use of basic models
or examples of the product being tested,

261
00:15:30.866 --> 00:15:34.533
low fidelity prototypes
can either be models that are cheaply

262
00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:38.600
and easily made or simply recounts
or visualizations of them.

263
00:15:39.166 --> 00:15:42.966
Examples of low fidelity prototypes
storyboarding.

264
00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.100
Let us now understand the advantages

265
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.100
and disadvantages of low fidelity
prototyping.

266
00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.833
High fidelity prototypes tend to include
all the visual components, interactive

267
00:15:54.833 --> 00:15:58.600
elements and content that will be featured
on the final product.

268
00:15:58.966 --> 00:16:02.300
In fact,
they look just like a real app or website,

269
00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.700
which is hugely beneficial
when it comes to user testing.

270
00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:09.933
Let us now understand the advantages
and disadvantages

271
00:16:09.933 --> 00:16:11.733
of high fidelity prototyping.

272
00:16:12.966 --> 00:16:13.766
Testing is the

273
00:16:13.766 --> 00:16:16.900
fifth stage in the five stage design
thinking process.

274
00:16:17.533 --> 00:16:22.266
Testing is often undertaken concurrently
with prototyping and performed well.

275
00:16:22.366 --> 00:16:26.766
It can provide many learning opportunities
to help you learn more about the user

276
00:16:26.766 --> 00:16:31.066
and opportunities to refine your prototype
and even the problem statement.

277
00:16:31.966 --> 00:16:37.300
Wizard of Oz Prototyping, WOz
Prototyping is a design methodology

278
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.300
used in rapid product development
to improve the user experience.

279
00:16:41.433 --> 00:16:42.800
UX.

280
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.233
Once the prototype has been created,
developers use Role-Playing to test

281
00:16:47.233 --> 00:16:49.600
how end users will interact
with the product.

282
00:16:50.833 --> 00:16:53.966
Card sorting is a technique
that involves asking users

283
00:16:53.966 --> 00:16:56.766
to organize information
into logical groups.

284
00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.900
Users are given a series of labeled cards
and asked to organize

285
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.966
and sort them into groups
that they think are appropriate.

286
00:17:04.533 --> 00:17:08.166
Card sorting helps you to design
and information architecture,

287
00:17:08.233 --> 00:17:11.600
workflow, menu
structure or website navigation paths.

288
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.666
Card sorting is a relatively low
tech and inexpensive

289
00:17:15.666 --> 00:17:19.733
method used to understand how a user would
organize and structure content

290
00:17:19.733 --> 00:17:21.700
that makes sense to them.

291
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.933
Card sorting can be conducted
in a number of ways, such as actual cards,

292
00:17:26.066 --> 00:17:30.533
pieces of paper, Post-it notes
or online tools such as optimal thought,

293
00:17:30.666 --> 00:17:33.266
which allow you to conduct the research
remotely.

294
00:17:33.866 --> 00:17:38.166
This insight allows you to understand
how users would expect to see content

295
00:17:38.166 --> 00:17:41.666
grouped on a website and how they might
see these groups labeled.

296
00:17:42.266 --> 00:17:45.833
Wild card sorting might not provide you
with the final information,

297
00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:47.966
architecture or menu for your site.

298
00:17:48.066 --> 00:17:52.800
It can help to identify trends and how
many potential categories there could be.

299
00:17:53.666 --> 00:17:56.300
When conducting a user test
on your prototype,

300
00:17:56.366 --> 00:17:59.766
it is ideal to utilize
a natural setting, IE

301
00:17:59.766 --> 00:18:03.266
the normal environment in which your users
would use the prototype

302
00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:06.600
if testing in a natural setting proves
difficult.

303
00:18:06.766 --> 00:18:11.700
Try to get users to perform a task or play
a role when testing the prototype.

304
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.033
The key is to get users
to be using the prototype

305
00:18:15.033 --> 00:18:17.900
as they would in real life
as much as possible.

306
00:18:18.866 --> 00:18:21.866
Feedback
capture matrix, facilitate realtime

307
00:18:21.866 --> 00:18:25.066
time, capture of feedback on presentations
and prototypes.

308
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:30.000
You can use a feedback capture matrix
either to give feedback on progress

309
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.900
within the design team
or to capture user feedback.

310
00:18:33.266 --> 00:18:37.300
The Matrix itself for changes, thoughts
and ideas into four categories

311
00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.500
for easy assessment.

312
00:18:39.533 --> 00:18:40.800
A few references for

313
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.800
further reading and learning.

314
00:18:45.533 --> 00:18:48.600
After completing this model,
you would have got the concepts

315
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.666
behind the various stages of design
thinking, lifecycle of design thinking,

316
00:18:53.833 --> 00:18:57.933
tools used in various stages of design
thinking, detailed

317
00:18:57.933 --> 00:19:03.000
learning on stage
one empathize, research your users needs.

318
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.200
Stage two Define, state
a user's needs and problems.

319
00:19:07.333 --> 00:19:11.500
Stage three Ideate,
challenge assumptions and create ideas.

320
00:19:11.666 --> 00:19:15.233
Stage
four Prototype, start to create solutions.

321
00:19:15.366 --> 00:19:18.633
Stage five Best Try your solutions out.

322
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.200
Thank you. Have a happy learning.
