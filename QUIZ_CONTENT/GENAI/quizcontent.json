    "answer": "To provide the model with information about the order of tokens in a sequence",
    "hint": "By design, Transformers don't have a built-in sense of sequence. This mechanism adds that context back in.",

    "answer": "It allows for meaningful new samples to be generated by sampling from this space",
    "hint": "A well-organized latent space means that points close to each other should decode into similar, coherent outputs.",
    "explanation": "By forcing the latent space to follow a specific distribution (like a standard normal distribution), the VAE ensures the space is smooth and continuous. This allows us to sample random points and decode them into novel but realistic data samples."
