    "hint": "Unlike classification, there isn't a simple 'accuracy' metric for how good a generated image is.",
    "explanation": "Evaluating GANs is challenging because there are no straightforward, objective metrics that perfectly capture both the visual quality (realism) and the diversity of the generated samples. Often, human evaluation is still required."

    "question": "How did implementing Transformer-based models impact the scalability of GlobeTech's machine translation services for new languages?",
    "options": [
      "It made scaling impossible due to hardware requirements",
      "It required complete manual rule-writing for each new language",
      "It improved scalability by leveraging pre-trained models that could be fine-tuned",
      "It had no effect on scalability"
    ],
    "answer": "It improved scalability by leveraging pre-trained models that could be fine-tuned",
    "hint": "Consider the concept of transfer learning.",
    "explanation": "By using large, pre-trained Transformer models like BERT and GPT, adding a new language became a matter of fine-tuning the existing model, which is far more efficient and scalable than training a new model from scratch."

  {
    "question": "What is a potential drawback of using a tokenizer with a fixed, limited vocabulary size?",
    "options": [
      "It makes the model train much slower",
      "It can lead to a limited understanding of text due to missed or unknown words",
      "It increases memory usage significantly",
      "It simplifies the model too much, causing underfitting"
    ],
    "answer": "It can lead to a limited understanding of text due to missed or unknown words",
    "hint": "What happens when the model encounters words that are not in its dictionary?",
    "explanation": "If the vocabulary is too small, many words will be classified as out-of-vocabulary (OOV). This loss of specific information can limit the model's ability to understand the full nuance of the text."

  {
    "question": "Which of the following would be an appropriate algorithm for grouping similar customers based on their purchasing behavior without any pre-existing labels?",
    "options": [
      "Linear Regression",
      "K-Means Clustering",
      "Support Vector Machine",
      "Decision Tree"
    ],
    "answer": "K-Means Clustering",
    "hint": "This is an unsupervised learning task where the goal is to find natural groupings in data.",
    "explanation": "K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised algorithm that aims to partition data points into a specified number of clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary advantage of pre-training a large Transformer model on a vast text corpus?",
    "options": [
      "It makes the model smaller and faster",
      "It allows the model to leverage general language understanding for downstream tasks",
      "It guarantees the model will be free of bias",
      "It eliminates the need for any task-specific fine-tuning"
    ],
    "answer": "It allows the model to leverage general language understanding for downstream tasks",
    "hint": "The model learns grammar, facts, and reasoning skills before it's ever shown a specific task.",
    "explanation": "Pre-training on a large corpus allows the model to learn a robust and nuanced understanding of language, which can then be transferred and adapted efficiently to various specific tasks through fine-tuning."
  },
  {
    "question": "In the context of VAEs for anomaly detection, how is an anomaly typically identified?",
    "options": [
      "By a very low reconstruction error",
      "When the data point falls into the largest cluster",
      "By a very high reconstruction error",
      "When the encoder output is zero"
    ],
    "answer": "By a very high reconstruction error",
    "hint": "The model learns to reconstruct 'normal' data well. What happens when it sees something 'abnormal'?",
    "explanation": "A VAE trained on normal data learns to reconstruct it with low error. When an anomalous data point is input, the model struggles to reconstruct it, resulting in a high reconstruction error, which flags it as an anomaly."

  {
    "question": "What does a GAN variant like 'Conditional GAN' allow a user to do?",
    "options": [
      "Generate images at progressively higher resolutions",
      "Generate specific outputs by providing a condition or label",
      "Improve the stability of the training process",
      "Translate images from one domain to another"
    ],
    "answer": "Generate specific outputs by providing a condition or label",
    "hint": "This adds a layer of control over what the GAN generates.",
    "explanation": "A Conditional GAN (cGAN) extends the basic GAN architecture by providing both the generator and discriminator with additional information, such as a class label, allowing it to generate specific, targeted outputs."

  {
    "question": "If a model's validation loss is consistently decreasing while its training loss remains high and is also decreasing (but at a slower rate), what can be inferred?",
    "options": [
      "The model is overfitting",
      "The model architecture is flawed",
      "The model is underfitting",
      "The model is perfectly trained"
    ],
    "answer": "The model is underfitting",
    "hint": "This scenario suggests the model is too simple and has not yet learned the patterns even in the training data.",
    "explanation": "Underfitting occurs when the model is not complex enough to capture the underlying structure of the data. High training loss indicates it's struggling to learn the training set, a classic sign of underfitting."

      "To program explicit, rule-based systems for every task",
      "To increase the computational speed of algorithms"
    ],
    "answer": "To allow computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed",
    "hint": "It's about finding patterns, not following a strict set of instructions.",
    "explanation": "The core concept of machine learning is to develop algorithms that can analyze data, learn patterns from it, and make decisions or predictions, rather than relying on hard-coded rules."

    "answer": "Handling long-range contextual meaning",
    "hint": "Earlier models like RNNs struggled to maintain context over long sentences.",
    "explanation": "Pre-Transformer models, particularly RNNs, had difficulty capturing dependencies between words that were far apart in a sentence. The self-attention mechanism in Transformers allows the model to look at the entire sentence at once, effectively solving this long-range dependency problem."
